## Description
# RII is an effect estimate proposed by Armas et al 2004 to compare a plants performance with neighbours and without.
# It was generated from a similar index that compares a subjects success between control and treatment plots (t-c)/(t+c)
# Heterogeneity stats are typically available for comparisons, but for simpler, within study examples, permutations tests can be used with parametric statistics. 
# Michalet et al. 2014 conducted these analyses in a 2014 Functional Ecology paper between cushion and open microsites.
