Tools for ecology and teaching courses

I have a few functions here that make ecology and course processing a bit easier. 
I'm by not means a professional scripter so while my codes are effecient, they tend to be bloated. 
I have included notes throughout most of the script so that you may modify them comfortably

Enjoy and fee free to contact me if you have questions!!
